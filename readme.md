# Metal Shears: Styled Lid


Planning doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Td_RFahmSV8Or_h0VA6uP0JDdDGzHRFhmkD5doB8iSY/edit



## Setup

I'm using git lfs from the start this time. Before cloning the repo, install git lfs from https://git-lfs.com/.
Then, run `git lfs install`.

I already added a few common file types to .gitattributes, feel free to add more via `git lfs track "*.whatever"`.
